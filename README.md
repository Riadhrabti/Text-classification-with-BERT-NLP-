Fine Tune BERT for Text Classification with TensorFlow
This is a guided project on fine-tuning a Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) model for text classification with TensorFlow.
I learned to preprocess and tokenize data for BERT classification, build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and train and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.
This project was made primarly to classify "sincere" and "uncincere" comments on the plateform quora however, it can be generalized to work on numerous other purposes.
